# My Portfolio 3.0 🎉

Check out my new portfolio! 1st attempt was using CSS and HTMl and less than a handful of lines of JavaScript. 2nd attempt was using more JavaScript to animate the page more and give it some cool effects. This third time I decided to build it using Next.js as it seems to be a very popular framework and some new tools to go along with it. 

## Motivation

Thought my portfolio could use a makeover and it seems like a pretty small project to begin using Next.js. I believe that with even this slight makeover, it can draw more attention to myself and better display my skills and progress through a nice and clean UI. This inspiration was taken from [chronark.com](https://chronark.com/) as this was an example from the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) website. 

## Main Technologies ⚡️

- `Next.js`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `Upstash`
- `Contentlayer`

## Project Dependencies

This section is more for my sake as I will be using new dependencies I have never worked with so I am detailing the use for each below:

*Note: descriptions are directly from NPM website*

- `@next/font`: includes a built-in automatic self-hosting for any font file. This means you can optimally load web fonts with zero layout shift, thanks to the underlying CSS size-adjust property used. 
- `@next/mdx`: use MDX with Next.js
- `@upstash/redis`: is an HTTP/REST based Redis client built for typescript, built on top of Upstash REST API
- `contentlayer`: is a content SDK that validates and transforms your content into type-safe JSON data you can easily *import* into your application's pages
- `framer-motion`: an open source motion library for React, made by Framer
- `lucide-react`: implementation of the lucide icon library for react applications
- `markdown-wasm`: very fast Markdown & HTML renderer implemented in WebAssembly
- `next-contentlayer`
- `react-wrap-balancer`: simple React component that makes titles more readable
- `rehype-autolink-headings`: rehype plugin to add links from headings back to themselves
- `rehype-pretty-code`: beautiful code blocks for your MD/MDX docs
- `rehype-slug`: rehype plugin to add *ids* to headings
- `remark-gfm`: remark plugin to support GFM (autolink, footnotes, strikethrough, tables, tasklists)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Running Locally

```sh-session
git clone https://github.com/kekedezha/dezhas-portfolio-2.0.git
cd chronark.com
```

Create a `.env` file similar to [`.env.example`](https://github.com/chronark/chronark.com/blob/main/.env.example).

Then install dependencies and run the development server:
```sh-session
npm install
npm run dev
```
