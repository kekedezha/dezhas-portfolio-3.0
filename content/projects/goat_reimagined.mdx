# GOAT 'REIMAGINED' 👟

GOAT 'Reimagined' is a redesign of a search on the streetwear/luxury website for sneakers, apparel and accessories, GOAT!

## Motivation ✍🏽

[GOAT's](https://www.goat.com/) current website has a UI/UX that is a bit outdated and has an unpleasant user experience, in my opinion. I wanted to start out with something simple and redesign part of the website because doing the full website might take a little bit more time and thought. I decided on a search for the Air Jordan 4 Retro. This obviously will not have every single shoe available but is more or less a preview of how the search would look like for the specified silhouette.

## Features ✨

- Add items to cart for 'purchase'
- Switch between the products and a cart view that updates as you select items to 'buy'
- Cart view has a 'place order' button that mimics a purchase

## Main Technologies 💻

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- DaisyUI
- TailwindCSS

## Future Improvements/Integrations 🤔

- Make more routes to the different pages you can go to and recreate the home page which is very overwhelming to look at/scroll through.
- Add in user authentication
- Set up a mock payment setup
- Continue integrating features bit by bit to 'replace' the current website
