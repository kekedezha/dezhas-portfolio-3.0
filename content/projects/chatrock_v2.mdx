ChatRock is a simple chat application (e.g. ChatGPT), that uses AWS Bedrock as the AI model to generate responses. It also uses Clerk for authentication and AWS DynamoDB for storing the chat messages and their history. Here's it in action! ðŸ‘‡

## Motivation

Over the last year, AI-powered applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini have taken the software/technology world by storm. They have exploded in popularity and have become widely used and integrated in lots of applications. This project aids in taking a look on how to use some of these new AI tools, and personally to gain some experience with tools I have never worked with, such as working with AWS and Clerk authentication!!
