# Dezha's Film Finder 2.0

## Description:

A web-app that uses The Movie Database's api to get a random movie based off of a user selected genre!
This project is a second iteration of my [film-finder](https://github.com/kekedezha/film_finder_pp) project where I interacted with [The Movie Database's](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US) api. However, with this version I used Next.js, Typescript tailwind, and shadcn/ui to create the web-app for a cleaner look.
