## Project Overview

In this project, I created an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today's most
accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. I created routes to manage 'minions', brilliant 'million dollar ideas', and to handle all the
annoying meetings that keep getting added to a busy schedule.

### Features

- CRUD operations for products, users, carts, and orders
- User authentication and authorization (JWT-based)
- Relational database integration with PostgreSQL
- API testing with Jest and Supertest
- Swagger documentation
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
