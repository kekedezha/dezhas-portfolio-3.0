Ahh where to start? I won't go into my whole backstory into how I got into coffee but it started very young and my first memory of it was having a cup of coffee during breakfast visiting my family in Mexico when I was 11 years old.

Today, it is part of my daily routine and although I don't need to have it to function, it is one of the little things in life that brings me immense satisfaction. My reason behind these little series I want to blog about is due my slow transition of trying to build my own coffee set up here at home! As I gradually build my home set up, I want to start with coffee basics and learn more about the whole process coffee goes through as it makes my way to a small mug in front of me every morning ☀️!

Well I keep I won't ramble too much longer and I'll get started with the first episode of this series!

Buen Provecho! ☕️

# Coffee Basics: Varieties

Believe it or not, there are many factors that affect the quality of coffee beans. The factors vary from the soil's health, the altitude from the farm that they are grown on, the rainfall they receive, processing and the main topic of this blog is the **plant variety**.

## Coffee Variety?

Coffee variety you say? Yes, there are actually many different types of coffee beans that each have their own unique flavors and distinct properties that produce different experiences.

To begin, the genus of coffee is <i>Coffea</i>, a flowering plant in the family of <i>Rubiaceae</i>. Under Coffea, there are at least 129 different species. The most commonly of these species and ones that you may have seen or heard of is coffee arabica and coffea canphora, commonly known as robusta. Arabica makes up approximately 70% of the world's coffee production and is less bitter and more complex in its acidity. Robusta on the other hand, while not making up quite as much production as arabica, is more bitter because of its higher caffeine content and is less complex in its acidity.

The different coffee varieties come in different shapes and sizes, and when brewed, they have distinct flavors and textures.

## Popular Coffee Varieties

The precise number of varieties of coffee beans that exist is really unknown. Ethiopia, a major producer of coffee beans, has more than 10,000 varieties alone.

Highlighted below are some different bean varieties that are common and/or are highly valued by coffee roasters and drinkers:

### Typica

The Typica variety is sweet, mild and not very complex when it comes to flavor profiles. Typica's notes of chocolate and nut take the center stage and are complimented by hints of spice. It has an acidity that is mild and balanced which conjures dried fruit and dark stone fruit, such as the likes of black cherry and plum.

### Bourbon

Bourbon has notes that deliver brown sugar-like sweetness, with fruit notes of cherry and peach and a sense of balanced body.

### Caturra

Caturra, has similar tasting notes to Bourbon, but is somewhat brighter.

### Gesha

The gesha variety has tea-like characteristics not usually found in coffee that has light, bright and floral notes.

### Catuai

Catuai, similarly to Bourbon, has brown sugar sweetness with notes of pastry and mild, cooked fruit. Pecan and almond flavors are also common.

### SL28

SL28 is known for grapefruit like brightness and a savory flavor similar to sundried tomatoes with a syrupy body.
